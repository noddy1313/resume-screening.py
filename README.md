Extracts text automatically from resumes  
Ranks resumes based on job description relevance  
Displays sorted ranking results in a table

3. **AI-powered ranking** is performed:  
   - Extracts text from resumes.  
   - Converts text into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**.  
   - Calculates **cosine similarity** between the job description and resumes.
